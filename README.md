#Flyleaf
*An app for reading things!*

##Front End
I've pretty much already decided that the look is going to follow android's native look, but not entirely

Because I've decided not to use big frameworks liek Angular or React, I'll be using many small libraries or
I'll be making them myself. Expecially the renderer, because it's not going to be a very dynamic app, we can
use react's philosophy of making minimal changed to the DOM when we have to but instead of having a whole 
virtual DOM we can use pre-determined cached templates. Not sure if it's much better but we'll see.

####DESIGN TOOLS & GUIDES

##Back End
A simple node http server for hosting, this will be an all (or mostly all) front end app.
