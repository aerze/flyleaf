*An app for reading things!*

-----
##Front End
Because I've decided not to use big frameworks like Angular or React, I'll be using many small libraries or
I'll be making them myself. Expecially the renderer, because it's not going to be a very dynamic app, we can
use react's philosophy of making minimal changes to the DOM when we have to instead of having a whole 
virtual DOM this is a better use case for cached templates. Not sure if it's much better but we'll see.

####DESIGN TOOLS & GUIDES

##Back End
A simple node http server for hosting, this will be an all (or mostly all) front end app.
